						Authentication is a term that refers to the process of proving that some
						fact or some document is genuine. In computer science, this term is
						typically associated with proving a userâ€™s identity. Usually, a user proves
						their identity by providing their credentials, that is, an agreed piece of
						information shared between the user and the system.
						<br />
						<br />
						<strong>
							Mostly, authentication process is done by transferring information
							through the string called token
						</strong>
						. Here is the diagram of the process when Front End application and Back End
						application make an agreement of authentication
